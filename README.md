# Circle-Game

   This code randomly draws circles outside of the visible area. Those circles then
   float onto the screen. Once they are on the screen they stay within the visible
   area and bounce off one another. The user controls one circle with their mouse 
   and the objective, for the user, is to capture other circles that are smaller than it.
   Each time the user circle captures another circle, it's area grows by the area
   of the circle it just captured, thus, allowing the user circle to become larger and larger
   until it can capture all of the circles on the screen. 
   
   Instructions for User:
      1) Maneuver your circle using the mouse
      2) As "attacking" circle float onto the screen, "capture" other circles that are smaller than yours until your circle 
        becomes large enough that you can "capture" every circle on the screen. 
      3) Right-click to access the menu. Options on the menu include:
         1) Next Level
         2) New Game
         3) Quit
